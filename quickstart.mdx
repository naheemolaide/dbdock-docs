## Setup your development

Learn how to set up DBdocks locally and start managing your backups.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js 18** or higher
- **PostgreSQL 12** or higher
- **PostgreSQL client tools** (`pg_dump`, `pg_restore`, `psql`)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Installing PostgreSQL client tools">
    **macOS**
    ```bash
    brew install postgresql
    ```

    **Ubuntu/Debian**
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install postgresql-client
    ```

    **Windows**
    Download from [PostgreSQL Downloads](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/)
  </Accordion>

### Initialize DBdocks

Run the interactive setup wizard to create your configuration file.

```bash
npx dbdock init
```

This command will guide you through:
1.  **Database connection**: Host, port, credentials.
2.  **Storage provider**: Local, S3, R2, or Cloudinary.
3.  **Encryption/Compression**: Security settings.
4.  **Email alerts**: Optional notification settings.

It will automatically create a `dbdock.config.json` file and add it to your `.gitignore`.

### Create a Backup

Once initialized, you can create your first backup immediately.

```bash
npx dbdock backup
```

You will see a real-time progress bar as your database is backed up, compressed, encrypted, and uploaded to your chosen storage.

```

✔ Backup completed successfully
```

### Restore a Backup

Restoring is just as easy. Run the restore command to see a list of available backups.

```bash
npx dbdock restore
```

Select the backup you want to restore, and DBdocks will handle the download, decryption, decompression, and restoration process.

```
