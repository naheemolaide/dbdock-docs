## Global Installation

You can install the DBdocks CLI globally on your machine using npm. This allows you to run `dbdock` commands from anywhere.

```bash
npm install -g dbdock
```

Once installed, you can verify the installation by running:

```bash
dbdock --version
```

## Usage with npx

Alternatively, you can use `npx` to run DBdocks without installing it globally. This ensures you are always using the latest version.

```bash
npx dbdock init
npx dbdock backup
```

## System Requirements

- **Node.js**: Version 18 or higher.
- **PostgreSQL**: Version 12 or higher.
- **OS**: macOS, Linux, or Windows.

## Troubleshooting Installation

If you encounter issues during installation, ensure your Node.js version is up to date.

```bash
node -v
```

If you see an error related to permissions, you might need to run the install command with `sudo` (on macOS/Linux) or run your command prompt as Administrator (on Windows).

```bash
sudo npm install -g dbdock
```
